Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: First 3 simulations are not much different in time, though they each take different amount of cycles.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 5th simulation takes reasonable time and is the most precise, so I would go with it.
